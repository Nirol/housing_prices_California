#  scatter by long/latt

housing.plot(kind="scatter", x="longitude", y="latitude", alpha=0.1)

#color for price
#radius for population

#
# This image tells you that the housing prices are very much related to the location
# (e.g., close to the ocean) and to the population density, as you probably knew already.
# It will probably be useful to use a clustering algorithm to detect the main clusters, and
# add new features that measure the proximity to the cluster centers. The ocean prox‚Äê
# imity attribute may be useful as well, although in Northern California the housing
# prices in coastal districts are not too high, so it is not a simple rule.
